## Overview

**Project Title**: Snake game

**Project Description**: This project is about the classic gSnake Game using Pythin and the Tkinter library. In the game, the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, consuming food items to grow longer. The objective is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body

**Project Goals**:
1. Develop a fully functional Snake Game with intuitive controls.
2. Implement a scoring system that tracks the player's progress.
3. Incorporate a feature to restart the game upon completion

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Install Python: Ensure that the python version is 3.6 or higher
2. install required Libraries: pip install Tkinter
3. Run the game: Python main.py

Instructions for using the software:

1. Starting the Game: Upon running the script, the game window will open, and the snake will beging moving automatically
2. Controlling snake: use the arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate the snake
3. Objective: Guide the snake tp consume the food item that appear randomly on the screen.
4. Game Over conditions: The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body.
5. Restarting the game: After a game over, a prompt will apper asking if you would like to play again

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Python 3.6
* Tkinter
